# tideman
## Description
Hardest problem I've completed at the time of writing (08/17/23), probably not just in CS, but overall.

Simulates a [Tideman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs) (AKA Ranked Pairs) voting method to determine the winner from a user-inputted list of candidates based off of user-inputted preferences from a user-inputted number of voters.
## Problem
Part of the week 3 pset for CS50x.\
Problem can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/3/tideman/)
## How to Use
> [!NOTE]
> To actually compile and run the file, you will need to download and use the [CS50 library](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50).

- Enter the terminal
- Compile the code using clang or CS50's `make tideman`
- Run the file using `./tideman "candidates"` (replace candidates with your candidates, with a space in between each)
- Input desired number of voters
- Input ranked preference of each candidate for each ballot
