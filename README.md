# tideman
## Description
Hardest problem I've completed at the time of writing (08/17/23), probably not just in CS, but overall.

Simulates a Tideman (AKA Ranked Pairs) voting method to determine the winner from a user-inputted list of candidates based off of user-inputted preferences from a user-inputted number of voters.
## Problem
Part of the week 3 pset for CS50x.\
https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/3/tideman/
## How to Use
Enter the terminal\
Compile the code using clang or CS50's `make tideman` \
Run the file using `./tideman "candidates"` (replace candidates with your candidates, with a space in between each)\
Input desired number of voters\
Input ranked preference of each candidate for each ballot
